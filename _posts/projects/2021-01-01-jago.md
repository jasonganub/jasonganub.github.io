<p>First onboarded engineer to build the backend infra, order management system, and payment gateway integration. Experimented with Chef, Ansible, Terraform, SSL autorenewals via scripting, and much more along the way. It was a great experience working with such ambitious peers in a very small and diverse team. The biggest takeaways was to build good enough engineering solutions, move fast, never sacrifice team culture, and that you can run a business on such limited software resources.</p>
